## Task1-Titanic Survival Prediction

Project Name: Titanic Survival Prediction

Project Description:
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow (optional)

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
Feature Engineering: Create and select important features for the model.
Model Training: Train the model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Prediction: Predict the survival of passengers based on new data.

## Task2-Iris Flower Classification

Project Name: Iris Flower Classification

Project Description:
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species. The dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow (optional)

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the Iris dataset.
Feature Engineering: Select and engineer features for optimal model performance.
Model Training: Train the model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Prediction: Classify new Iris flower data into the correct species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Task3-Credit Card Fraud Detection
Project Name: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Project Description:
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This project involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow (optional)
Imbalanced-learn

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize the transaction data.
Class Imbalance Handling: Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
Model Training: Train classification models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Fraud Detection: Classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine based on the model's predictions.
